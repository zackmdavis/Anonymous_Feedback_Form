## Anonymous Feedback Form

Sometimes people are wrong and bad, and would benefit from being told about the exact ways in which they are wrong and bad (so that they know what to work on improving), but no one tells them out of fear of potential social consequences, which concern vanishes or is greatly attenuated if the subject doesn't know _who_ specifically is telling them about these particular ways in which they are wrong and bad.

Thus, this very simple web application (written with Python 3.4 and Django 1.8) to solicit anonymous feedback about a person.
